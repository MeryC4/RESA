Analysis of Systemic Properties and Tradeoffs

Analyze the standard with respect to the following:
○ Describe the architectural drivers that the framework, standard, 
  or product is trying to address and how these are related to the context. 
  Specifically discuss how the architectural approaches (structures, tactics, etc.) support the key goals and context.
○ What architectural drivers are inhibited and why? What tradeoffs have been made?
○ Are there any architectural drivers that the standard does not seem to explicitly 
  support but seem to be relevant to the context? Should they be explicitly addressed or 
  do they not matter – justify your answer? Can you analyze how well these other
  architectural drivers are supported (or not supported) by the artifacts and design descriptions you were able to find?
